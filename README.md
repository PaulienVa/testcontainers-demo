# Revolutionizing Testing with Testcontainers - Bridging Real Dependencies and Code Quality
Demo project for this talk:

Using testcontainers software can be tested against real dependencies. Forget about version discrepancies, subtile differences in queries and bugs in mocked components. Using testcontainers in your tests will shorten the feedback cycle to the duration of the build and reduce the test environment to a simple sanity check.
